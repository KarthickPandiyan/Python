Technical questions asked in my recent interview
=====================================

◉ SQL

1. A query related to the usage of normal group by like ‘Find the person with the highest salary in each department’.

I have provided a similar problem in the comments, which is taken from Sagar Prajapati's YT channel.

2. The second question is similar to the question Ankit Bansal posted a few days ago here:

The interviewer gave me similar tables and told me to provide the output for the inner and left join. A video explanation can be found in the comments.

◉ Python

1. Write a program to reverse a string without using the reverse function.

In Python, there is a concept called "slicing." We can use it to reverse any string in a single line.
Like this, string[::-1]

2. Write a program to reverse a list without using the reverse function.

In the list also, we can use the same slicing method, but at the same time, we also need to prove that we can build the logic as well, so here I used a for loop to solve this problem.

3. Provide an approach for dealing with a problem like this.

[1,2,3,4]
[3,5,7]
[8,12]
[20]

So if you see the first list, the second list is derived like this.
1+2 = 3
2+3 = 5
3+4 = 7

And the series goes on like this till we get a single element in the list.

So here, a possible approach is to use a concept called recursion.

"Recursion is when a function calls itself within its code, thus repeatedly executing the instructions present inside it."

I’ve provided a sample solution to the problem using recursion below.
